# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
The primary objective of this project is to showcase proficiency in key data science skills, including data wrangling, visualization, and application of statistical models. 

Python Programming Language Proficiency: Develop a strong foundation in writing python code, and using libraries and frameworks specifically designed for data analytics, such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn. Python concepts like Functions, Methods etc.

Data Collection and Exploration: Gain proficiency in accessing & integrating relevant data from diverse sources (using APIs or from Databases), Cleaning and transforming data using Python, Loading data into a database using Python, Performing EDA, including using both descriptive statistics and visualizations.

Data Preprocessing and Statistical Modeling: Understanding & exploring relationships, identifying trends and patterns in data using statistical models, applying/ evaluating/ interpreting the results of the statistical models (to understand the factors influencing the number of bikes in a given location).
