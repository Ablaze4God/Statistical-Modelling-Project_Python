# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
The primary objective of this project is to showcase proficiency in key data science skills, including data wrangling, visualization, and application of statistical models. 

Python Programming Language Proficiency: Develop a strong foundation in writing python code, and using libraries and frameworks specifically designed for data analytics, such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn. Python concepts like Functions, Methods etc.

Data Collection and Exploration: Gain proficiency in accessing & integrating relevant data from diverse sources (using APIs or from Databases), Cleaning and transforming data using Python, Loading data into a database using Python, Performing EDA, including using both descriptive statistics and visualizations.

Data Preprocessing and Statistical Modeling: Understanding & exploring relationships, identifying trends and patterns in data using statistical models, applying/ evaluating/ interpreting the results of the statistical models (to understand the factors influencing the number of bikes in a given location).

## Process
Explored the structure of the APIs. Queried the APIs endpoints to retrieve information and studied the Data returned.

Parsing JSON object into Pandas Data frame. Compared quality data from City Bike, Foursquare and Yelp API. Created an SQLite database, merged and store the data in the Database (this was done to allowed easier data manipulation & analysis and required me to have a better and deeper understanding of JSON structures / efficiently extract relevant information from nested data). 

Performed EDA to explore the possible relationships within the data and utilized visualizations, such as box plots, to compare the number of bikes with other various factors.

Built Regression Model (appplied statistical modeling techniques) to investigate validity of initial hypotheses and explore the impact of independent variables (in particular, the relationship between the number of bikes and other various factors / characteristics).

## Results
Results from the API End Points were extensive and contained lot of details. Yelp API however was better because it had more relevant details and a cleaner structure.

## Challenges 
Choosing the right API endpoint (Retrieving the right data from the API) and selecting an optimal city with enough bike stations.

Had significantly challenge / difficulty parsing the JSON file received from the API End Point into a Data frame and required a deep dive into understanding nested structures.

Time constraint (while completing the project) due to multiple pressing demands at work and at home.

## Future Goals
Spent more time on data cleaning for increased model effectiveness.

Use more advanced Python code to achieve same task (fewer lines of code).
